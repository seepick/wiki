* ad simple turn
	- whenever doing a simple turn, it's possible to go into embrace, by keep holding the hands (resulting in a 90 degrees turn of the lines)
* transition lateral to basic via simple turn
	- stroke from the back over arm to hand in a continuous (non-broken) line
* ad embrace
	- 3 ways to enter embrace:
	- 1) on the spot (simple, but "interrupting")
	- 2) travelling turn (difficult leader footwork)
	- 3) from lunge (90 degrees turn, smooth, easy)
* ad soltinho
	- simplest way to switch roles; but have to change from beat count 5 to 1, e.g. with a short bounce/bodywave (in basic/lateral)
	- can practice footwork alone: cross-shape with quarter turns; or half turn for left-right; or 3-quarters for a challenge ;)
* lunge simple turn
	- left arm is in front of the shoulder, and does NOT go sideways (otherwise far distance to "travel")
	- also do very small step sideways in lunge

* terminology
	- embrace: arms wrapped around (shoulder/waist), lateral footwork
	- open/closed position: basic step, indicating distance
	- half-open position: when opened in viradinha (side-by-side)
* ad yin-yang principle
	- e.g. very beginning to start; back-down-forward + keep frame throughout; it resembles the quality of "collecting" the follower
* announcing a move
	- use soft/slow quality, otherwise misinterpreted as a move-signal (sharp, fast, direct)
* amount of tension
	- another criteria is musicality; hard/fast/strong beat, use more pressure/force
	- keep tension as low as possible, to have space left to increase tension; necessary to indicate a change/break (of the rhythm/flow/direction)
	- also use more force when safety requires, e.g. social on the dancefloor to avoid collisions
	- it must be a deliberate choice; same as with keeping lines
* keep orientation
	- in basic, keep chest/sternum straight facing the follower; if uncomfortable, only turn head, but not whole upper body
	- in lateral, rotate upper body towards follower
* posture
	- keep shoulders always back, engage rhomboids (muscles between shoulder blades)
	- e.g. when sending follower out from basic to lateral
* zouk bodyscan
	- to build confidence, to create your comfort zone
	1) soft hug around with right arm on follower's back
	2) left arm = noodle arm, relaxed hanging down
	3) upright, shoulders back, and oriented towards partner
* leader styles
	1) the father: a stable container, more rigid, grounded, static/stiff
	2) the brother: playful collaborator, less stable, dyanmic, dances together
