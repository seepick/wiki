* ad lateral
  - pull hands towards hip/waist (not "passing by")
  - rotate (from center, frame-connection, not arm alone) to give direction (make follower turn)
* ad simple turn (from lateral to basic)
  - step out of the follower's line completely, even already in the first steps
  - don't block follower's path; allow her to do a full lateral (continuation)
  - walk around more closely (requires predictable step distance/direction of both) to not have to rush
  - possible don't reach for shoulder blade, but leave only left-hand connection to allow more distance (avoid "catching"/grandpa style)
  - tuum: side-step left on your own line, chick: right step on follower line (where follow was standing), chick: cross follower line
* ad entering embrace (from lateral)
  - always create space to allow the follower doing a travelling-turn
    * never stationary on-the-spot, as it interrupts back-forth continuation of the follower
  - requires leader to do side-steps: don't go immediately to the left (too much distance, breaking frame)
    * finish left side side-basic, then cross right leg behind, side step, and then right crossing front, travel with the follower
* ad embraced to body-wave
  - how to do it more smoothly, melting; use an approach which resembles an "airbag"; "merging" into each other without a hard bump; soft squeeze, soft hug
  - roll the point of contact smoothly from the hand to the arm (forearm, elbow, upper arm) into the body
  - do that on both sides, on shoulder, and especially around waist, to roll into the side contact during body-wave
* ad head movements
  - lead by moving your own body
  - give less input, otherwise unbalances the follower
* ad rotisserie
  - keep palm facing down throughout (no arm/hand rotation, only when leader does rotation as well)
* ad balao
  - when in lateral, going to rotisserie: it's actually more like a tilted turn, head stays on the side; create more bent dynamic
* general rule: give more weight (follower)
  - to build connection, more than butterfly touch necessary
  - in basic: give weight of arm, relaxing into, maybe even almost pushing (but not with the hand); lean with back into leader's hand
  - in closed embrace share weight, shoulder/upperarm; in open embrace with hands
  - the more advanced, the less weight is necessary (skill); some moves require more connection-pressure, but use it as a spice only (technique); some is just about how to like to dance (personal preference), for this develop a meta skill to quickly read it
* general rule: continuation
  - don't interrupt the flow of the follower
  - keeping the lines free, maintaining the back-forth rhythm in basic/lateral
