* repeat:
    * bodyscan: frontal position, L noodle, R up
    * sendout from basic to lateral: stay upright/keep frame
    * lateral to embrace, continuation through advanced footwork
    * embrace bodywave smooth transition
* FRAME: why?
    * to establish connection, and why that? for communication (sending signals/intentions)
        * dance is nicer/enjoyable/working when we understand each other
        * listen/speak clearly through a medium (connection/frame) which transmits information reliably
    * frame is not a means to its own end!
    * you can have no (visible/outer) frame at all, as long as connection is clear
    * keeping a bit more lose structure? not so upright (uptight? ballet style): have a look at cedric & romana: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwtCbQYnVQo
    * what is a "correct" position? this, which allows connection/communication
* PERSONAL mistake: keep FRAME! stay upright, proud!
    * sendout from basic to lateral
    * lateral, simple-turn, (HERE) to basic
    * during embrace walk

* initial POSITION arms/hands (to be able to push/pull information):
    * fingers around scapulae
    * hand-balls around latissimus dorsi
    * elbows(s) up, and follower has hers outside (to be able to push into it)
* initial POSITION body:
    * facing each other frontal
    * when getting closer, then leader turn out slightly 1) avoid penis rubbing and 2) titties not arm touch

* ad VIRADINHA: (footwork)
    * don't cross too much on follower's line
    * R step back (not sideways), to give her space
    * staggered shoulders, not center-aligned
* ad WAVES: (frontal stance)
    * snake: down and inwards; circle and oval (for big version)
    * seaweed: up and outwards/away
    * as usual: leading by example, doing it yourself (not only visually, but also communicates through body)
    * difference seaweed/chicote is in weight shift by changing shape of circle: seaweed is horizontal oval shape, chicote is vertical oval shape
    * change snake to seaweed/chicote when weight is back, never when on front leg
    * AD WIKI: make graphic
* ad BOUNCES:
    * make it round, elastic frame, "dampeners" by soft elbows/shoulders
    * hand position: don't bend wrists! when pushing, rotate hands "outwards"
* ad EMBRACE (enter): from lunge to lateral, just turn a bit more to stay on original line
* ad EMBRACE (exit): pull left hand, show direction, and NOT push with hand on the back
* ad ROTISSERIE (exit): pull earlier, when head height (not shoulder height), otherwise follower keeps rotating

@ewa:
* regarding doterra alternative: this is where i order my essential oils now: https://fete.nl
* regarding "gaga dance": so beautiful to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H8beZLmY7A mesmerizing her body control and still being able to stay so soft/relaxed, effortless; saturday morning there are gaga classes in amsterdam here, in case you can ever make yourself free and feel like it: https://hjs.gymstudio.com
* and yes yes yes, cedric&romana, looks much more like what i would like to aim for, thank you for the recommendation
